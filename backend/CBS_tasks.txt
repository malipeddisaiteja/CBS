Create Postman Get and Post API calls to simulate the below steps as part of the demo

3. Create Customer by sending a POST request to the appropriate endpoint.
    3.1 Include customer details such as name, address, contact information, and initial balance.
    3.2 Account ID and Account Type should get associated with customer or accounts table
    Note: one customer can have multiple bank accounts, at that time we need to maintain the customer and accounts table seperate to handle one           customer and multiple bank accounts, for this project this feature is excluded

5. Demo the Balance Inquiry feature by sending a GET request to retrieve the account balance.
